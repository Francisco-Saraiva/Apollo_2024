# Apollo_2024
Code for Apollo Project: Edge computing for closed-loop brain computer interfaces

For more information on the project, go to RedMine wiki:

Regarding the folders present here:
* "Final Product" is the version where the code runs as fast as it can, without any stops, to simulate a real situation
* "Test Frequencies" is the code related to check what is the maximum frequency the MCU is detecting at a given time
* "Test Signal" is the code related to check the different waveforms and processsing stages of the MCU (the signal as it is received, the low-pass filter,etc.)
* "Test Time" is the code that tests how much time it takes for a single round of processing
